AU,Medicare Levy,26001,32500,10,"Medicare Levy shade-in (phase-in) zone. For income between the threshold ($26,000) and the shade-in ceiling ($32,500), levy = 10% x (taxable income - threshold). The 10% shade-in rate means the levy phases in gradually until it equals 2% of total taxable income. Shade-in ceiling = threshold / (1 - levy_rate/shade_in_rate) = $26,000 / (1 - 0.02/0.10) = $26,000 / 0.80 = $32,500. At $32,500: 10% x ($32,500 - $26,000) = $650 = 2% x $32,500. Above the ceiling, standard 2% applies.

Indian 482 visa holders are generally NOT Medicare-eligible (no RHCA with India) and may be exempt from the levy — but most still pay it if they have Medicare coverage through other means or are not exempt.","ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/medicare-and-private-health-insurance/medicare-levy",2026-02-18,N
