(2) NAC OSCE is held at designated centres across Canada — travel to Canada is mandatory for this exam. (3) MCCQE Part 1 can be taken at Prometric centres worldwide including India. (4) CaRMS fee depends on number of programs ranked: base CAD$325 + CAD$35 per program; typical IMG applies to 12-20 programs. (5) Provincial medical license fee varies by province: CPSO Ontario=CAD$525; CPSBC British Columbia=CAD$575; CPSA Alberta=CAD$450 — Ontario (CPSO) used as reference. (6) physiciansapply.ca manages source verification of medical credentials for MCC; WES (World Education Services) may also be required for immigration credential assessment. (7) Work permit fee: CAD$255 standard; study permit CAD$150; open work permit CAD$100; biometrics CAD$85 additional. (8) PR via Express Entry: processing fee CAD$850 + right of permanent residence fee (RPRF) CAD$515 + biometrics CAD$85 = CAD$1450 total. (9) NAC OSCE pass rate for IMGs historically ~60-65% — coaching is strongly recommended. (10) Residency in Canada is PAID — residents earn CAD$55k-75k/yr during training; however securing a CaRMS match is highly competitive for IMGs with ~30-35% match rate in first iteration. (11) MCCQE Part 1 fee increased from CAD$1280 to CAD$1395 effective 2025. (12) AUD/INR rate 63.42 used only for OET fee conversion."
