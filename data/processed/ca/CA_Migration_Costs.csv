NOTE: MCCQE Part 2 was officially discontinued by MCC in June 2021 (see mcc.ca/news/the-mcc-ceases-delivery-of-the-mccqe-part-ii/). The pathway no longer requires Part 2. --- FEE CHANGES: MCCQE1 increased from CAD$1,395 to CAD$1,500. NAC OSCE increased from CAD$2,830 to CAD$3,320 (significant increase). CaRMS fee structure changed: now CAD$301.60 match participation fee (includes first 4 programs) + CAD$64.96 per additional program (previously CAD$325 + CAD$35/program). --- MIN SCENARIO (INR 567,000): 1x MCCQE1 (99720) + 1x NAC OSCE (220714) + IELTS not OET (17000) + Provincial license CPSO (34902) + CaRMS 10 programs = CAD$691.36 (45954) + Credential verification (46204) + Work permit CAD$255 (16952) + NO PR (0) + No coaching (0) + Budget travel 1 trip (50000) + Budget accommodation (24000) + PCC (2000) + Medical (10000) = INR 567,446 ≈ 567,000. --- TYPICAL SCENARIO (INR 829,000): 1x MCCQE1 (99720) + 1.5x avg NAC OSCE attempts (331071) + OET (37500) + CPSO (34902) + CaRMS ~15 programs = CAD$1,016.16 (67554) + Credential verification (46204) + Work permit (16952) + NO PR (0) + Mid coaching (75000) + Travel 1 trip (65000) + Standard accommodation (40000) + PCC (3500) + Medical (12000) = INR 829,403 ≈ 829,000. --- MAX SCENARIO (INR 1,412,000): 2x MCCQE1 (199440) + 2x NAC OSCE (441428) + OET (37500) + CPSO (34902) + CaRMS 20 programs = CAD$1,341.96 (89204) + Credential verification (46204) + Work permit (16952) + PR Express Entry CAD$1450 (96396) + Full coaching (150000) + Travel 2 trips (180000) + Premium accommodation 2 trips (100000) + PCC (5000) + Medical (15000) = INR 1,412,026 ≈ 1,412,000. --- KEY NOTES: (1) MCC exam pathway is now: MCCQE1 (computer-based MCQ) -> NAC OSCE (clinical stations) -> CaRMS match into residency -> LMCC. (2) NAC OSCE is held at designated centres across Canada — travel to Canada is mandatory for this exam. (3) MCCQE Part 1 can be taken at Prometric centres worldwide including India. (4) CaRMS fee structure changed for 2026 cycle: participation fee of CAD$301.60 includes 4 programs; additional programs CAD$64.96 each (previously base $325 + $35/program). Typical IMG applies to 12-20 programs. (5) Provincial medical license fee varies by province: CPSO Ontario=CAD$525; CPSBC British Columbia=CAD$575; CPSA Alberta=CAD$450 — Ontario (CPSO) used as reference. (6) NAC OSCE pass rate for IMGs historically ~60-65% — coaching is strongly recommended. (7) Residency in Canada is PAID — residents earn CAD$73k+ in Ontario during training (PGY1 per PARO 2025-26); however securing a CaRMS match is highly competitive for IMGs with ~30-35% match rate in first iteration."
