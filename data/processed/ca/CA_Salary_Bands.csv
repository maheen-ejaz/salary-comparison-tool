Min=$200,000 reflects entry-level family medicine/general practice or lower-paying specialties (public health, psychiatry) in salaried academic positions; Typical=$280,000 reflects mid-career salaried specialist in an academic centre or family physician in a well-compensated provincial model; Max=$350,000 reflects senior salaried specialist in high-demand specialty or with administrative/leadership premium.

Salaried physicians typically earn less gross than fee-for-service but have zero overhead costs, receive employer-paid benefits (health/dental/CMPA in some provinces), pension contributions (HOOPP in Ontario ~$20-30k/yr employer match), paid vacation (4-6 weeks), and CME allowances ($2,000-5,000/yr).

CRITICAL: FFS figures are GROSS billings before overhead. Overhead costs (clinic rent, staff, equipment, supplies, insurance, billing) typically consume 25-40% of gross for office-based practices (family medicine ~30%, surgical ~20%, radiology ~35-40%). Net income after overhead is substantially lower. CMPA fees ($3,000-$60,000+/yr by specialty) are additional. No employer pension — physicians must fund own retirement. Physicians pay both employee and employer CPP contributions (self-employed rate). Provincial billing numbers required to practice FFS."
