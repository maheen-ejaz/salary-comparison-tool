All provinces have standardized single-rate pay for each PGY year — no range within a given province/year.

Residents receive benefits (health/dental) through provincial associations. Annual hours worked typically 50-60 hrs/week.

Salaried staff physician positions in Canada exist primarily through Alternative Funding Plans (AFPs) in academic centres and provincial salary models (e.g., Ontario AFP, Alberta ARP, BC salaried models, Maritime provinces). Min=$200,000 reflects entry-level family medicine/general practice or lower-paying specialties (public health, psychiatry) in salaried academic positions; Typical=$280,000 reflects mid-career salaried specialist in an academic centre or family physician in a well-compensated provincial model; Max=$350,000 reflects senior salaried specialist in high-demand specialty or with administrative/leadership premium. CIHI 2022-23 data: average gross clinical payment per physician $380,000 (all payment models combined, before overhead). Salaried physicians typically earn less gross than fee-for-service but have zero overhead costs, receive employer-paid benefits (health/dental/CMPA in some provinces), pension contributions (HOOPP in Ontario ~$20-30k/yr employer match), paid vacation (4-6 weeks), and CME allowances ($2,000-5,000/yr).

Fee-for-service (FFS) is the dominant payment model in Canada — approximately 70% of physician payments. Enormous variation by specialty. Min=$250,000 reflects family medicine gross billings in lower-billing provinces or early-career (CIHI 2022-23 average FM gross billings ~$340,000); Typical=$350,000 reflects mid-career family physician or lower-billing specialist gross billings (CIHI overall average gross clinical payment ~$380,000 in 2022-23); Max=$600,000+ reflects high-billing procedural/surgical specialties (ophthalmology avg ~$790k, cardiac surgery ~$670k, radiology ~$570k, orthopaedics ~$540k gross per CIHI 2022-23). CRITICAL: FFS figures are GROSS billings before overhead. Overhead costs (clinic rent, staff, equipment, supplies, insurance, billing) typically consume 25-40% of gross for office-based practices (family medicine ~30%, surgical ~20%, radiology ~35-40%). Net income after overhead is substantially lower. CMPA fees ($3,000-$60,000+/yr by specialty) are additional. No employer pension — physicians must fund own retirement. Physicians pay both employee and employer CPP contributions (self-employed rate). Provincial billing numbers required to practice FFS."
