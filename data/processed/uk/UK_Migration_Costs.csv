PLAB fees shown are April 2026 rates (£283/£1036); the current 2025-26 fees are £273/£998 — candidates booking before April 2026 will pay the lower rates. MIN/TYPICAL/MAX totals reflect different scenarios: Min=1 attempt each exam + IELTS (not OET) + no coaching + budget travel + state accommodation; Typical=1 PLAB1 + 1.5avg PLAB2 attempts + OET + mid-range coaching + 1-2 trips to UK; Max=2 attempts each exam + OET + prep course + full coaching + 2 UK trips + premium accommodation. IMPORTANT VISA NOTE: The visa and IHS costs shown use the Skilled Worker Visa (£769) and IHS (£1035/yr × 3yr = £3105). However, most NHS-employed doctors qualify for the Health and Care Worker (HCW) Visa which costs only £304 (up to 3 years) AND provides FULL EXEMPTION from the Immigration Health Surcharge. Using the HCW visa route, visa+IHS costs drop from INR 478,826 to just INR 37,574 — saving approximately INR 441,000 (£3,570). The Min/Typical/Max totals above use the Skilled Worker Visa as a worst-case estimate; actual costs for NHS doctors are significantly lower. GMC Annual Retention (Year 1) is included in all totals. PLAB 2 is held in Manchester — travel and accommodation to UK are mandatory costs. Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) is paid by employer — NOT included. Coaching is optional but strongly recommended.
